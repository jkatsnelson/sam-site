              Fabio Viviani Wines is a company headed by Fabio Viviani, a restaurant owner and celebrity chef known for his appearances on Top Chef. FVWines approached us to redesign their website in order to leverage Fabio Viviani's celebrity status to both promote his wines and promote wine pairing with his recipes. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Our challenge was to redesign FVWines' responsive website to showcase Fabio Viviani's personality, educate users about his wines, promote recipes to pair wines with, and bolster the ecommerce aspect of the site, all without preexisting UX research or design. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I worked within a team of four: while all four of us created our own distinct designs, we provided daily critique to each other, led weekly meetings and exercises with our client, and conducted usability tests on our designs to ensure we were designing sound UI and UX.

              In our first meetings, we aimed to <strong>uncover Fabio Viviani Wines' goals for the redesign</strong>. We asked if they wanted to keep any of the existing site design, if they wanted to keep within the style guide they already had, what their brand values were, who their target audience was, and if there were any development constraints to consider. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We learned <strong>they wanted a complete redesign</strong>, and that there was no accompanying UX research or design. Our clients sought to <strong>leverage Fabio's celebrity status</strong> and personality to build recognition, using the site to <strong>highlight how to pair the wines</strong>, ideally with Fabio's recipes. Their goal was to have the wines and the recipes coexist in order to turn users into frequent visitors.
              <br>
              <br>
              Before the redesign, their site audience was predominantly women in their mid-forties to mid-sixties; our clients wanted to lower the age of the visitors to those in their mid-twenties to early thirties. They asked us to create <strong>contemporary, accessible designs</strong> that felt rustic, authentic, and modern.

          After our initial meeting with our clients, we explored nine websites: a combination of ecommerce wine sites, celebrity chefs' websites, and visual inspiration for younger audiences. I gained the most insight from these:

                Winc is an ecommerce wine company that also owns Club W, a monthly wine subscription. The site is clean, friendly, and modern. It boldly pairs a delicate serif with a blocky sans-serif serif, which, in combination with its pale salmon and blue-green palette, appeals to a younger, more feminine audience.

          From our exploration, we learned what worked and what didn't. We decided the redesigns needed to utilize hover states so the site felt inviting, not static. The designs needed to be friendly and accessible in order to encourage repeat visitors and convert first-time users into power users.
          <br>
          <br>
          The most successful sites had crisp, clean photography which immediately pulled the user into the overall experience. We decided our designs needed to lean on photography of the food, wine, and Fabio, using it to balance negative space and content as not to overwhelm the user.

          In addition to looking at other sites, I dug into the existing Fabio Viviani Wines site to explore areas that needed the most work. Because no UX research or design was conducted prior, I felt it particularly important to get a feel for the current site to figure out its largest problems.

          Overall, the site lacked hierarchy and guidance.
          <strong>
            Elements felt oversized, user goals were ambiguous, navigation was confusing and complicated.
          </strong>
          It wasn't clear that users could purchase wine on the site, and there were unusual ecommerce patterns including a disappearing cart.
          <br>
          <br>
          Many items were static despite being clickable, and there was no way to easily filter recipes and wines, making the search experience cumbersome.

          and felt the colors and serif header represented Fabio Viviani Wines well. They liked the way the “Friendly” style tile portrayed the wines and how the “Mediterranean” style tiled incorporated icons to show pairings, but said they felt too “Martha Stewarty”.
          <br>
          <br>
          I took their feedback about all the styles and used it to move onto my designs.

        <p>
          Because there wasn't any previous UX work, usability testing was particularly important. I focused my initial mockups on the homepage and the wines page, plus worked through changes to the navigation. I tested for usability and desireabilty, and used the feedback to iterate on my designs.

        <p>
          Overall, users felt like the designs felt old and busy due to the backgrounds. The designs felt too rustic, and didn't highlight Fabio enough from the get-go. Users expressed confusion about the naming of the pairings page, and wanted the homepage to focus more on the wines and recipes.

          I took the feedback from the usability testing and from client meetings and created two more iterations before I came to my final responsive designs. I sought to keep the site authentic and rustic, while also appealing to people in their twenties and thirties. 
          <br>
          <br>
          As per the client's needs and goals, I redesigned the most important pages: the navigation and header, the homepage, the wines flow, the recipes flow, the “About Fabio” page, and the press kit page for distributors.

          During our second-to-last client meeting, our clients mentioned that there were four wines in Fabio Viviani Wines' collection because collectively, they paired well with every kind of food. I redesigned my homepage design to reflect this, and gamified experience. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Due to feedback I received in the usability tests, I made changes to the hero image and copy, added a call to action button above the fold, and adjusted the layout of the page to reflect the importance of wines, recipes, and Fabio. 
        </p>
        <div class="desktop-and-mobile-comps">
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/desktop-wine-selector-comp.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/mobile-wine-selector-comp.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I changed this page to “Wines”, and focused on bringing the user to more information about the wines. For users new to wine, I designed a filter that chose a wine for them. Users select what kind of food they want to eat, what kind of notes they like (sweet, full, hearty, etc), and whether they prefer red or white, and the filter chooses a wine for them. I also made it possible to hover and click on a wine, for users who knew what they wanted.
        </p>
        <div class="desktop-and-mobile-comps">
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/desktop-wine-item.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/mobile-wine-item.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I redesigned this page to showcase the wine and guide the user to purchase. I designed this page for two types of users: shoppers who are interested in learning more about the wine and what it pairs with, or those looking to purchase online. In my design, I sought to make it easy to do both.
        </p>
        <div class="desktop-and-mobile-comps">
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/desktop-recipes.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/mobile-recipes.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to create a more immersive experience, excite the user, and make the recipes feel authentic, I designed carousels of larger images of the food, organized by type. I designed a filter for users to narrow output by type of food or wine pairing, further connecting the wines with the recipes.
        </p>
        <div class="desktop-and-mobile-comps">
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/desktop-recipe-item.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/mobile-recipe-item.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          I redesigned the individual recipe pages to showcase the recipe and make it easy for the user to cook from the site. I segmented the ingredients and the cooking steps, and added checkmarks for users to check off their prgress along the way. At the end I included an option to jump to the wine pairing, thus connecting the wines and the recipes.
        </p>
        <div class="desktop-and-mobile-comps">
          <div class="img-container">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/wine-nav.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Through testing feedback and researching navigation patterns, I redesigned the naviagtion in order to clearly show the site's goals and highlight the fact that users can buy wine. On the main header, I changed “Shop” to “Wines” and designed multiple level drop down to give the user the information they needed in smaller chunks. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I changed my initial blue to a more contemporary taupe, which paired well with the navigation's soft black and eggplant. I moved the cart to be permanently in the navigation to make it clear that wines can be purchased; I also added a log in to increase sales and encourage users to return. I also moved the “trade” section to the footer and renamed it “press kit”, as that is a more commonly used name and placement.

          For the future of Fabio Viviani Wines I created a style guide that was applicable to both future designs and development. I outlined my design treatments to create an overall design language, which included colors, photography treatment, UI elements, and design patterns.

          Because I only had three weeks on this project and there was no formal UX design, there's still work to be done on this site. More testing needs to be conducted to ensure that the navigation and flow are fully usable and intuitive. The checkout and purchase flow needs to be designed, as well as the remaining pages of the site, including more wines, recipes, and news articles.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout my process I worked to develop a design language to translate my designs across new screens. I extensively detailed the patterns I created, making it easy for future designers to come forth and continue the work I started.

        <p>
          Ultimately, I was happy with the work I produced. It was difficult working without previous UX contributions, and I had to juggle the needs of UX while creating a visually pleasing language. That said, I found it incredibly rewarding to be able to dig into the UX while also working on the UI. It was fun to be able to create a site experience that was both beautiful and more user-friendly. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I learned how to create navigations and flows that created an experience for users, and I gamified aspects of the site to encourage user involvement. I used my designs to solve problems I found in the existing site, including unclear navigation, haphazard hierarchy, lack of user guidance, and an overall static feeling site. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I redesigned the site with the goals of turning new users into repeat users, highlighting the ecommerce aspect of the site to make it easier for users to purchase the wines online, and increasing time spent on the site. My design choices improve future users' experience and help my client convert users and help Fabio Viviani Wines gain a more fruitful following. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I thrived on the feedback I recieved during the weekly meetings with my clients and the multiple rounds of usability testing, and learned how to ask more pointed questions to get the feedback I needed to evolve my designs. The regular critique and feedback I recieved made me more confident in my design decisions and helped me take my designs to the next level, setting me up for my final client project, Spore.
