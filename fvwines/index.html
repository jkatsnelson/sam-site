FVWines approached us to redesign their website in order to leverage Fabio Viviani’s celebrity status to both promote his wines and promote wine pairing with his recipes.<br><br>Our challenge was to redesign FVWines’ responsive website to showcase Fabio Viviani’s personality, educate users about his wines, promote recipes to pair wines with, and bolster the ecommerce aspect of the site, all without preexisting UX research or design.<br><br>I worked within a team of four: while all four of us created our own distinct designs, we provided daily critique to each other, led weekly meetings and exercises with our client, and conducted usability tests on our designs to ensure we were designing sound UI and UX.</p><button>VIEW PROTOTYPE</button><header class="row"><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"><hr><h2>Defining the Challenge</h2><hr></div></header><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/original-homepage.png"><div class="image-subtitle">Fabio Viviani Wines’ original homepage</div><p>In our first meetings, we aimed to <strong>uncover Fabio Viviani Wines’ goals for the redesign</strong>. We asked if they wanted to keep any of the existing site design, if they wanted to keep within the style guide they already had, what their brand values were, who their target audience was, and if there were any development constraints to consider.<br><br>We learned <strong>they wanted a complete redesign</strong>, and that there was no accompanying UX research or design. Our clients sought to <strong>leverage Fabio’s celebrity status</strong> and personality to build recognition, using the site to <strong>highlight how to pair the wines</strong>, ideally with Fabio’s recipes. Their goal was to have the wines and the recipes coexist in order to turn users into frequent visitors.<br><br>Before the redesign, their site audience was predominantly women in their mid-forties to mid-sixties; our clients wanted to lower the age of the visitors to those in their mid-twenties to early thirties. They asked us to create <strong>contemporary, accessible designs</strong> that felt rustic, authentic, and modern.</p><header class="row"><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"><hr><h2>Exploring the Wine & Food Space</h2><hr></div></header><p>After our initial meeting with our clients, we explored nine websites: a combination of ecommerce wine sites, celebrity chefs’ websites, and visual inspiration for younger audiences. I gained the most insight from these:</p><!-- competitive analysis description --><div class="carousel sam-image-carousel slide" id="mobile-wine-carousel-1"><!-- Wrapper for slides --><div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox"><div class="item active"><div class="slide-title">Winc</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/winc.png"><div class="slide-content">Winc is an ecommerce wine company that also owns Club W, a monthly wine subscription. The site is clean, friendly, and modern. It boldly pairs a delicate serif with a blocky sans-serif serif, which, in combination with its pale salmon and blue-green palette, appeals to a younger, more feminine audience.</div></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Mario Batali</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/mario-batali.png"><div class="slide-content">Mario Batali is a celebrity chef known for his larger-than-life personality. Like Fabio Viviani, his site showcases his recipes and his personality. Batali’s site is bold and dark with a heavy, condensed font. The food is prominently displayed, but when paired with the heavy typography the whole site feels cluttered.</div></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Woven Magazine</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/woven.png"><div class="slide-content">Woven is a magazine known for its soft, “hipster” design. It’s full of fun microinteractions and hover states that add to the site’s beauty. It pulls the user in with crisp, curated photography, ample use of white space, and small touches that make the site feel chic.</div></div></div><!-- Indicators --><ol class="carousel-indicators"><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-1" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-1" data-slide-to="1"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-1" data-slide-to="2"></li></ol><a class="left carousel-control" href="#mobile-wine-carousel-1" role="button" data-slide="prev"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="sr-only">Previous</span> </a><a class="right carousel-control" href="#mobile-wine-carousel-1" role="button" data-slide="next"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div><p>From our exploration, we learned what worked and what didn’t. We decided the redesigns needed to utilize hover states so the site felt inviting, not static. The designs needed to be friendly and accessible in order to encourage repeat visitors and convert first-time users into power users.<br><br>The most successful sites had crisp, clean photography which immediately pulled the user into the overall experience. We decided our designs needed to lean on photography of the food, wine, and Fabio, using it to balance negative space and content as not to overwhelm the user.</p><header class="row"><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"><hr><h2>Exploring the Existing Site</h2><hr></div></header><p>In addition to looking at other sites, I dug into the existing Fabio Viviani Wines site to explore areas that needed the most work. Because no UX research or design was conducted prior, I felt it particularly important to get a feel for the current site to figure out its largest problems.</p><div class="carousel sam-image-carousel slide" id="mobile-wine-carousel-2"><!-- Wrapper for slides --><div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox"><div class="item active"><div class="slide-title">Homepage: Wines</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/original-site-images/homepage-wines.png"></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Homepage: Information</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/original-site-images/information.png"></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Recipes & Pairings</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/original-site-images/recipes-and-pairings.png"></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Shop Wines</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/original-site-images/shop-wines.png"></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Shop Wines: Add to Cart</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/original-site-images/add-to-cart.png"></div><div class="item"><div class="slide-title">Navigation</div><img src="/images/wine/carousel/original-site-images/navigation.png"></div></div><!-- Indicators --><ol class="carousel-indicators"><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" data-slide-to="1"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" data-slide-to="2"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" data-slide-to="3"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" data-slide-to="4"></li><li data-target="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" data-slide-to="5"></li></ol><a class="left carousel-control" href="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" role="button" data-slide="prev"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="sr-only">Previous</span> </a><a class="right carousel-control" href="#mobile-wine-carousel-2" role="button" data-slide="next"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span> <span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div><p>Overall, the site lacked hierarchy and guidance. <strong>Elements felt oversized, user goals were ambiguous, navigation was confusing and complicated. </strong>It wasn’t clear that users could purchase wine on the site, and there were unusual ecommerce patterns including a disappearing cart.<br><br>Many items were static despite being clickable, and there was no way to easily filter recipes and wines, making the search experience cumbersome.</p><header class="row"><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"><hr><h2>Crafting Visual Direction</h2><hr></div></header><div class="sub-header"><h3>Design Principles</h3><hr></div><p>In addition to presenting our findings to our clients, we led exercises to further clarify the visual direction of the brand and dig into preferred aesthetics.

I sought to keep the site authentic and rustic, while also appealing to people in their twenties and thirties.<br><br>As per the client’s needs and goals, I redesigned the most important pages: the navigation and header, the homepage, the wines flow, the recipes flow, the “About Fabio” page, and the press kit page for distributors.</p><div class="desktop-and-mobile-comps"><div class="img-container"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/desktop-homepage-comp.png"></div><div class="img-container"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/wine/mobile-homepage-comp.png"></div></div><p>During our second-to-last client meeting, our clients mentioned that there were four wines in Fabio Viviani Wines’ collection because collectively, they paired well with every kind of food. I redesigned my homepage design to reflect this, and gamified experience.<br><br>Due to feedback I received in the usability tests, I made changes to the hero image and copy, added a call to action button above the fold, and adjusted the layout of the page to reflect the importance of wines, recipes, and Fabio.</p></section></main><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
